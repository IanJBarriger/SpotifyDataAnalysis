# Spotify Data Analysis and Visiualization

This project used a collection of my personal Spotify data dating from February 2021 to January 2025 to collect insight into artist and listening trends. The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and manipulation, while Tableau was used for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
* Python
  - Jupyter Notebook 
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
* Tableau

This data was sourced from Spotify as a JSON file and converted into a CSV file to be used as a data frame. Using Pandas and Numpy, the data was cleaned by removing missing values, correcting data types, and determining qualifying streams. This cleaned data frame wsa used to analyze listening habits, including Top Artist, Top Songs, time related habits, and total listening times. Key insights were visualized using Tableau where an interactive dashboard was created to show streaming rates for my top 10 artists.

## Dataset:
The dataset includes information about Spotify tracks such as:
* Time Stamp
* Platform
* Milliseconds Played
* Country Streamed
* IP Address
* Track Name
* Artist Name
* Album Name
* Album Name
* Spotify Track URI
* Reason Start
* Reason end

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
