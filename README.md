# Spotify Data Analysis and Visiualization

This project used a collection of my personal Spotify data dating from February 2021 to January 2025 to collect insight into artist and listening trends. The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and manipulation, while Tableau was used for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

* Python
  - Jupyter Notebook 
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
* Tableau

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
